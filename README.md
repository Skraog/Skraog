# 🧪 About Me
Hello! I'm Void, formerly known as Skraog. <br>
I code on my free time as a hobby and I don't have any main project ongoing at the moment.

## 🆎 Languages
I usually code in **Typescript / Javascript / Python** but I do try new things from time to time.

## 📍 Currently...
Working on Discord bots that achieve all kinds of things such as game integrations, API's or just regular features. <br>
- Now started using Typescript instead of Javascript; I'm still learning

## 💖 Loves...
Trying new things and succeeding even if it takes 100 years. <br>
Programming, selfhosting and overall system administration.
